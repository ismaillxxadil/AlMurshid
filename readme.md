## 💡 About The Project

Project planning is often tedious, and many developers get stuck in "tutorial hell" or lose motivation halfway through a build. **ALMurshid** (The Guide) solves this by combining **Generative AI** with **Gamification**.

It transforms the software development lifecycle into an RPG (Role-Playing Game). You don't just complete tasks; you earn XP, level up your profile, maintain daily streaks, and unlock unique badges based on your coding habits.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Architect
- **Smart Generation:** Input a simple idea, and the AI generates a comprehensive development plan with Phases, Tasks, and Complexity estimates.
- **Context Awareness:** Generates tasks specifically tailored to your selected tech stack.

### 🎮 Gamification Engine
- **XP System:** Earn Experience Points for every task completed based on difficulty.
- **Dynamic Badges:** Unlock achievements automatically via Database Triggers:
  - 🦉 **Night Owl:** For committing code between 2 AM - 5 AM.
  - 🛡️ **Defender:** For maintaining a 7-day activity streak.
  - 🏗️ **Architect:** For creating multiple comprehensive project plans.
- **Leaderboard:** Track your progress against your own past performance.
